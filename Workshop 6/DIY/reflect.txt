Reflection

In this workshop, we have learnt the implementation of copy constructor and copy assignment operator that how we can assign the current object
to the class type that is being copied and copying the values in the object which are being copied into the new allocated memory. We habve also
learnt how to implement input and output operators i.e reading the values and displaying it using the class type. We have also implement the
friend helper function to display the rewuired output. The issue I faced was with the load function. The way I implement the load function was
not able to read all the values and the second careless mistake of mine at the first was i forgot to add one of the text files to my directory
which was add.txt due to which i was getting some of the values wrong and some of them mixing. These were the common mistakes I had faced
issue with. For the DIY part, it didnt took that long than LAB part for this workshop.
